Developer Guide
---------------

Introduction
============

The purpose of this document is to help aid in understanding the development of all the
scripts. It is more general than the API documentation and should give a high level
understanding of the code.

Architecture
============

There are 4 modules that make up the script, *mtc.py*, *mtc_helpers.py*, *legacy.py*, and *mtc_classes.py*.
The Module *mtc* is the main module that can be executed with *legacy* being an extension of it that can be executed.
Modules *mtc_helpers* and *mtc_classes* are libraries of functions and classes that *mtc* and *legacy* use.

Starting with module *mtc*, the code is organized into sections determined by actions. These actions are:

- Downloading
- Unzipping
- Importing
- Compressing
- Archiving
- Cleanup

The overall structure of these scripts is to use more of a functional structure. Modules *mtc_helpers* contain many
functions that *mtc* uses with list comprehensions to keep this structure. Almost each section of *mtc* is broken up
into two functions where there is one function calling that one in a list comprehension. Functions *download_logs* and 
*download_log* can be used as an example:

.. literalinclude:: mtc.py
   :linenos:
   :pyobject: download_logs
   :emphasize-lines: 19

.. literalinclude:: mtc.py
   :linenos:
   :pyobject: download_log

\* *Line 19 in the function download_logs shows the list comprehension*
